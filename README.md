# Habit Tracker App with Gamification (Bachelor’s Thesis Project)

A full-stack habit tracking application designed as my Bachelor’s thesis project.  
Developed under the one-on-one mentorship of a senior front-end engineer, this project reflects industry-level practices, clean architecture, and consistent coding standards.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The Habit Tracker App helps users build long-term habits through:
- Daily tracking  
- Progress visualization  
- Level-based gamification  
- Clean, intuitive UI  
- Secure authentication  

This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement a complete web application — **frontend, backend, architecture, deployment-ready structure, and API communication**.

- Practical understanding of **CORS**, routing, middleware, validation, and API data flow  
- Structuring clean and maintainable React codebases  
- End-to-end flow of form validation, state management, and API communication  
- Building secure authentication with JWT  
- Working with ORMs (**Sequelize**), data modeling, and migrations  
- Industry-like coding workflows (mentor-guided)
